How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
 was introduced?

  
Yes although the commands acte and display differently.  



How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
Yes it is easier to compare files or modify small changes you don't like.

    



What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

 
You could forget to commit, but the good thing is that it doesnt save work you aren't sure of saving.
 


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Many coding files are connected in which changes to one file affects the rest

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
By comparing the diferences

 when adding or removing lines



How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that 
could break something?


By allowing me to revert to previous changes.



Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
